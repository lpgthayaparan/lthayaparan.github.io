abstract: Short-term probabilistic forecasts of the trajectory of the COVID-19
  pandemic in the United States have served as a visible and important
  communication channel between the scientific modeling community and both the
  general public and decision-makers. Forecasting models provide specific,
  quantitative, and evaluable predictions that inform short-term decisions such
  as healthcare staffing needs, school closures, and allocation of medical
  supplies. Starting in April 2020, the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub
  (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collected, disseminated, and synthesized
  tens of millions of specific predictions from more than 90 different academic,
  industry, and independent research groups. A multi-model ensemble forecast
  that combined predictions from dozens of different research groups every week
  provided the most consistently accurate probabilistic forecasts of incident
  deaths due to COVID-19 at the state and national level from April 2020 through
  October 2021. The performance of 27 individual models that submitted complete
  forecasts of COVID-19 deaths consistently throughout this year showed high
  variability in forecast skill across time, geospatial units, and forecast
  horizons. Two-thirds of the models evaluated showed better accuracy than a
  na√Øve baseline model. Forecast accuracy degraded as models made predictions
  further into the future, with probabilistic error at a 20-week horizon 3-5
  times larger than when predicting at a 1-week horizon. This project
  underscores the role that collaboration and active coordination between
  governmental public health agencies, academic modeling teams, and industry
  partners can play in developing modern modeling capabilities to support local,
  state, and federal response to outbreaks.

title: "MSOM, 2021: COVID-19: A Multipeak SIR Based Model for Learning Waves and
  Optimizing Testing"
abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has been marked by several waves. Traditional
  epidemiology models are not equipped to handle them. We propose a novel
  multiwave SIR model, which can dynamically detect and model the waves of a
  disease by pairing the SIR model's compartmental structure with a change-point
  detection martingale process. We show analytically this process is expected to
  detect COVID-19 waves in under a week. We find the multiwave model improves
  MAPEs by 15%-25% over the original SIR for state-level predictions in the USA.
  Our model outperforms most of the CDC models in long-term predictions.

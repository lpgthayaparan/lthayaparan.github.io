title: "INFORMS, 2020: Solving High Dimensional Challenges Through Projection In
  Fast Fashion Prediction"
abstract: High dimensional data is a blessing and a curse, often necessary for
  the most interesting machine learning problems but bringing with it
  feature-correlation, noise and long runtimes. This is especially true in
  retail, where a large amount of information is needed to make optimal
  decisions. In this research we have partnered with a world-renowned fast
  fashion company to propose a new method for feature reduction through
  projection with the end goal of solving supervised learning problems. We
  present a supervised-learning alternative to Principal Component Analysis
  (PCA) that finds uncorrelated, lower dimensional features which best explain
  differences in the dependent variable (e.g sales).
